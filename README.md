# Description of The Problem:

The goal of the project is to design, implement and evaluate a Support Vector Machines (SVM) learning algorithm on a specific Social Network Ads task which consists of determining whether a user purchased a
particular product based on some given features describing the user.


# Description of Support Vector Machines:

SVM is a type of supervised learning algorithms in machine
learning -need labeled data to train- to solve classifications and regression problems, it is an
attractive and popular approach that its main idea of this approach is class separation-based
learning is to find the best possible separation between classes that decision boundary with
largest possible distance of data instances.


# How Support Vector Machines Work

SVM transform input data into a higher-dimensional space using kernel functions, making it
easier to find linear separations or classifications. SVMs handle both linear and non-linear data
by using different kernels, like linear, polynomial, or RBF, to capture complex patterns. During
training, SVMs find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes and
minimizes errors. The choice of kernel function is crucial for performance and depends on the
data's characteristics.
